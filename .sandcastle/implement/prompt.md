# TASK

Implement issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

You are on branch `{{BRANCH}}`, already created from `main`. Pull in the
issue with `gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --comments`. If it has a
parent PRD, pull that in too.

# CONTEXT

Read `CONTEXT.md` and any relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/` before
starting. Explore the repo and fill your context with the parts
relevant to this issue — especially test files that touch the area
you'll change.

# EXECUTION

Use red-green-refactor where applicable.

1. RED: write one failing test
2. GREEN: implement to pass it
3. REPEAT until the issue is done
4. REFACTOR

Before committing, run `pnpm run typecheck` and `pnpm run test`.

# COMMIT

Make one or more git commits on `{{BRANCH}}`. Use conventional-commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`).

Do not close the issue yourself.
