/**
 * What the camera move's version does to the export address.
 *
 * An export is CONTENT-ADDRESSED: a Video whose address has not changed is not
 * re-exported, whatever the code now does. The move's arithmetic is code and
 * not data, so it is invisible to the address — which means a fix to the move
 * reaches every Video EXCEPT the ones that already have the old move baked into
 * a file. `OVERLAY_CAMERA_VERSION` is how the address is told.
 *
 * It has to be told PRECISELY. Bumping `EXPORT_VERSION` would re-export the
 * whole library to produce, for almost every Video, exactly the bytes it
 * already has. So the version rides on an Overlay whose Kind actually moves the
 * camera, and on nothing else — and that is the pair of facts this file pins,
 * from both sides, with the literal addresses themselves.
 *
 * It lives apart from `export-hash.test.ts` because that file is at the repo's
 * per-file size limit.
